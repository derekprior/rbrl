# RBRL 2026 Schedule Feasibility Report

## League Structure

- **10 teams** in 2 divisions of 5
  - **American Division**: Angels, Astros, Orioles, Mariners, Royals
  - **National Division**: Cubs, Padres, Phillies, Pirates, Rockies
- **13 games per team** (65 total games)
  - Each team plays divisional opponents **twice** (4 opponents × 2 = 8 games)
  - Each team plays inter-division opponents **once** (5 opponents × 1 = 5 games)

## Season Dates

- **Opening Day**: Saturday, April 25, 2026
- **Regular Season End**: Sunday, May 31, 2026
- **Duration**: 37 calendar days (~5.3 weeks)
- **Makeup Week**: June 1–5, 2026 (reserved for rainouts)

## Blackout Dates

| Date | Day | Reason |
|------|-----|--------|
| May 10 | Sunday | Mother's Day |
| May 23 | Saturday | Memorial Day Weekend |
| May 24 | Sunday | Memorial Day Weekend |
| May 25 | Monday | Memorial Day* |

\*Memorial Day is blacked out from the initial schedule but remains available as a
Sunday-style makeup day (5:00 PM games) if needed.

## Fields

3 fields available: **Moscariello Ballpark**, **Symonds Field**, **Washington Park**

Some fields will have reserved dates/times due to high school baseball (Freshman, JV,
Varsity) that will reduce weekday capacity. These reservations are not yet finalized and
are not factored into the numbers below.

## Game Times & Slot Rules

| Day Type | Time Slots | Games per Slot | Max Games/Day |
|----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Weekdays (Mon–Fri) | 5:45 PM | 2 | 2 |
| Saturdays | 12:30 PM, 2:45 PM, 5:00 PM | 2 per slot | 5\* |
| Sundays & Holidays | 5:00 PM | 2 | 2 |

- **Max 2 games per timeslot** across all fields (umpire availability constraint).
  This means 1 of the 3 fields sits idle each timeslot.
- \*Saturday maximum is 5, not 6, because with 10 teams and a 1-game-per-day-per-team
  rule, only 10 of the 12 available team-slots can be used (5 games × 2 teams each).

## Scheduling Rules

### Hard Constraints (will not be violated)

- No team plays more than **1 game per day**
- No team plays **3 days in a row**
- No team plays more than **3 games in a given week**

### Soft Constraints (preferred, reported as warnings if violated)

- Avoid a team playing **3 games in any 4-day window**
- Avoid **rematches within ~2 weeks** of the first meeting
- **Balance Sunday games** roughly evenly across teams
- **Balance pace of play** — keep all teams within a similar number of games played
  at any point in the season (no team far ahead or behind)
- **Balance home/away** assignments across teams

## Capacity Analysis

### Available Playing Days

| Day Type | Count | Dates |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Weekdays | 24 | Mon–Fri across 5 weeks (excludes Memorial Day) |
| Saturdays | 5 | Apr 25; May 2, 9, 16, 30 |
| Sundays | 4 | Apr 26; May 3, 17, 31 |
| **Total** | **33** | |

### Game Capacity

| Day Type | Playing Days | Games/Day | Total Games |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Weekdays | 24 | 2 | 48 |
| Saturdays | 5 | 5 | 25 |
| Sundays | 4 | 2 | 8 |
| **Total** | | | **81** |

### Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total games needed | 65 |
| Total game capacity (before field reservations) | 81 |
| **Surplus slots** | **16** |
| Utilization | 80% |
| Max games/team possible (3/week × 6 weeks) | 18 |
| Games needed per team | 13 |

### Per-Team Weekly Breakdown (approximate)

With 65 games over ~5 weeks, teams will average **2.5 games per week**. The 3-game
weekly cap provides enough headroom to shift games between weeks as needed.

## Impact of Field Reservations

High school baseball reservations will reduce weekday capacity. Each reserved
field-timeslot removes 1 potential game from a weekday. Estimated impact:

| Reservations Lost | Adjusted Capacity | Surplus |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 0 | 81 | 16 |
| 5 | 76 | 11 |
| 10 | 71 | 6 |
| 15 | 66 | 1 |

**Up to ~14 weekday field reservations can be absorbed** before the schedule becomes
infeasible. Beyond that, Memorial Day (May 25) can be activated as a makeup day
to add 2 more slots.

## Conclusion

**The schedule is feasible.** 65 games fit comfortably into the available 81 slots
(80% utilization) with a 16-slot surplus to absorb field reservations and leave
open slots for rainout makeups. The constraint rules (max 3 games/week, no 3
consecutive days) are well within the capacity of a 5-week season for 13 games
per team.

Key risks to monitor:

- **High school field reservations**: If more than ~14 weekday slots are lost,
  the schedule tightens significantly.
- **Extended rain stretches**: The June 1–5 makeup week provides a safety valve,
  and Memorial Day can be activated if needed.
- **Umpire availability**: The 2-games-per-timeslot cap limits midweek and Sunday
  capacity. A 3rd crew would not help on Saturdays (already capped at 5 games by
  the 10-team / 1-game-per-day limit) but could add a 3rd Sunday game or midweek
  game on fields not reserved for varsity practice.
